What is imposition?
===================

Imposition is a process in publishing where one takes a series of pages and arranges them so they can be folded and bound, reducing paper waste.

Web Imposition
==============

Web Imposition is a web page capable of doing this process within your browser for simple, staple-bound booklets. No files get uploaded onto a server. Instead, everything is done in-browser.

Supported File Types
====================

PDF files, images, and zip archives are all supported. Either drag the files from another window into the main view space, or file list, or use the import feature and select multiple files.

For zip archives, if every file in the archive is an image, they will each be put into the document.

Real View
=========

When selected, Real View shows pages in the order they are meant to be read. This allows you to check that pages are in the correct order before printing and get a preview of how the final document will look.

Imposed View
============

Conversely, selecting Imposed View will show what the pages look like after being rearranged for print. Selecting this view prior to printing or saving will make sure the new document has gone through the imposition process.

Print and Save
==============

When you save or print, Web Imposition will output pages in either Real or Imposed view. If you wish to impose your document for print, make sure Imposed View is selected.

Since Web Imposition does everything in-browser, it uses the browserâ€™s print dialog to print and save. If you wish to save your document to be printed elsewhere, instead of selecting a printer, simply save to a PDF.

Saving with Real View selected will save a PDF with the pages in order but merged as page spreads.

Printing from Imposed View will print the pages in a way where they can be folded and bound.

Page spreads
============

Imported images and PDF pages which are in landscape orientation are automatically made to take up a two-page spread.

Crease Margins
==============

The more sheets of paper that are used in a staple-bound booklet, the more space in the center of the book will be taken up by the thickness of the pages. For images which span two pages, this can make it so the center gets covered up by other sheets of paper.

The crease margin will shift the page images from the center of the booklet, slightly spacing things out from the center. This can be tweaked to make images running along multiple pages of a booklet better align.

Manga Mode
==========

If the pages are meant to be read right-to-left, select this box. Right pages and left pages will be swapped.

Back cover fill feature
=======================

In simple booklets, one sheet of paper can hold four pages: the front and back each have a left and right page. Because of this, the number of pages in a document needs to be a multiple of four, including the front and back cover.

If a document does not have the correct number of pages, Web Imposition will insert blank pages until the count is a multiple of four.

However, if the last page in the document is not meant to be the back cover (maybe you don't want to spoil the ending), then you can uncheck the "Back cover" box, and Web Imposition will insert blank pages at the end of the book, and the final page will be blank.
